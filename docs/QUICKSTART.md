   - Or drag it into your browser

## âœ… Verify It's Working

   âœ… PH Service Status API running on http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Open `phservicestatus.html` in your browser

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Backend server not running" error

**Solution:** Make sure you started the server first with `npm start`

### Problem: Services show "ERROR" status

**Solution:**

1. Check that the server is running on port 3000
2. Visit http://localhost:3000/health in your browser
3. If it shows `{"status":"ok",...}`, the server is working

### Problem: npm command not found

**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Problem: Port 3000 already in use

**Solution:**

1. Close any other applications using port 3000
2. Or edit `server.js` and change `PORT = 3000` to another port like `3001`
